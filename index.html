      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Since childhood, I have always admired my mother. She has been my greatest inspiration, 
        shaping me into the person I am today. I grew up as an adventurous child, 
        always seeking excitement in everything I did. Whether it was playing salakinto or basketball, 
        I was always drawn to physical activities. I loved being outdoors, surrounded by friends, 
        always on the move, and embracing every challenge that came my way.</p>
      <p>I was fortunate to have a supportive family who always wanted the best for me. We were deeply religious,
        attending church regularly and actively participating in its activities. As a child, I became an “angel,”
        one of the kids who danced during church events. Later, in my adolescence,
        I took on a more significant role as an altar server, further strengthening my faith and sense of discipline.</p>
      <p>Aside from my love for physical activities, I also had a passion for the arts.
        I explored different interests while maintaining good academic performance.
        High school was one of the best times of my life. I built strong friendships,
        sharing countless adventures and valuable lessons with my friends. We traveled to different places,
        played sports together, and learned from one another. I admired many athletes who became my role models,
        inspiring me to push my limits both physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>Of course, life was not without challenges. One of my struggles was being skinny,
        which made me self-conscious. Another was financial hardship. However,
        I never let these difficulties define me. My childhood friends and I worked together to overcome them.
        We exercised regularly to build our strength and took on various jobs to earn money.
        We watered plants, fetched water for neighbors, and even worked in construction.
        Through these experiences, I learned the value of hard work and resilience.</p>
      <p>Despite the hardships, my high school years were filled with adventure.
        My friends and I traveled to other municipalities just to play basketball and volleyball.
        We painted walls for fun, dared to try the spirit of the glass,
        and even sneaked out of the house just to enjoy our time together. Some days,
        we would cut classes to swim in the river, moments that defined our youthful energy and bond.</p>
      <p>All these experiences have shaped me into the person I am today,
        an adventurous individual who always seeks excitement while striving to make my parents proud.
        Whether academically or physically, I have always aimed to leave a mark,
        embracing life with passion and positivity. I believe that life is meant to be lived to the fullest, 
        and I will always choose to do what excites.</p>
